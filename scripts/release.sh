# P13.3. The one place a release version is decided, so `scripts/release.sh`
# run locally and `.github/workflows/bump.yml` cannot drift apart.
#
# The version in Cargo.toml is the version to release. It is raised only when
# that version is already tagged — which is what makes the first run publish
# 0.0.1 instead of skipping to 0.0.2. dist creates the tag and the GitHub
# Release itself (dispatch-releases in dist-workspace.toml), so this script's
# job ends at "the version commit is on the remote, the workflow is running".
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh [patch|minor|major] [--dry-run|--local|--no-bump]
#   --dry-run  print the version that would be released and change nothing
#   --local    make the version commit but neither push nor start the workflow
#   --no-bump  release the version in Cargo.toml only if it is untagged; never
#              raise it (release-plz.yml after a merged release pull request)
